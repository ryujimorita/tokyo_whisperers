# tokyo_whisperers
 This is the final project for Georgia Tech's Deep Learning course (CS 7643). We aim to enhance Japanese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by fine-tuning OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model on Japanese-specific data, assessing whether it can outperform the monolingual ReazonSpeech models in accuracy.
